# Headingsmap Translations

This repository is meant to have a place to have the translations of the texts and labels that the extension has. The
texts are divided in two groups:
* Translations that are added programmatically. They are labels that are in json files under the directory "_locales".
* HTML contents that are static. They are HTML files that are located in different folders under the directory "html".

So far there are two language versions, English and Spanish. If you want to contribute translating it, that would be very 
welcome, so thank you in advance. Just follow the normal github process (fork the repository, etc.). If you don't know how
to do it, you can also download all and then send it to me.

If you have any doubt, concern, or there are texts that are not clear, do not hesitate and write me, or alternatively
create an issue in the repository.
